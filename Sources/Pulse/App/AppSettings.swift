/// that is stored: each setting's declaration and its documentation, grouped by
/// topic. What a change *does* — the key it is written under, the callback it
/// fires, the global it keeps in step — is in that topic's file:
///
/// | File | Topic |
/// |---|---|
/// | `AppSettings+Application` | menu bar item, Dock icon, shortcuts, language |
/// | `AppSettings+Panel` | the floating panel: visibility, size, rail metrics, glass |
/// | `AppSettings+Rings` | how a ring looks: tint, mark, clock, warning colour, pinned window |
/// | `AppSettings+Accounts` | which accounts exist, which are shown, in what order |
/// | `AppSettings+Providers` | per-provider choices: routes, sites, balance basis, proxy, cadence |
/// | `AppSettings+TokenSpend` | the Token spend pane |
/// | `AppSettings+Notifications` | alert rules |
/// | `AppSettings+Recap` | the monthly recap |
/// | `AppSettings+WindowStarter` | the window starter |
///
/// **Two callbacks, and the difference is a network request.** `onChange`
/// is the usage loop's hook: `AppDelegate` answers it by re-placing the panel
/// *and* asking every provider again. `onLayoutChange` re-places the panel and
/// nothing else. A setting that changes only how Pulse draws or places itself
/// goes through the second; reaching for `onChange` there costs every
/// provider a request for a figure that did not change.

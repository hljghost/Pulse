/// Signs, in this Mac's Codex sessions, that the work was quietly given less
/// than was asked for. **Signs, not proof** — and only what Codex writes down.
///
/// The one fact that would settle it — which model the server actually ran —
/// is never saved: Codex reads it from a response header and keeps the
/// warning it raises on a mismatch out of the session file (`ModelReroute` is
/// transient in `codex-rs/rollout/src/policy.rs`). Finding it means sending a
/// probe or sitting in the traffic, and Pulse does neither: it reads.
/// What *is* written leaves two kinds of trace, and this reads both.
///
/// **Reasoning cut short.** Every response's `token_count` event carries
/// `last_token_usage.reasoning_output_tokens`. Reasoning that stops on its own
/// lands on any count; reasoning that is cut lands on 516, 1034, 1552… —
/// `518·n − 2`, a lattice found in openai/codex#30364 over 390k responses and
/// reproduced on this Mac (gpt-5.5: 41.6% of responses that reached 516
/// stopped exactly on it; the codex models, none). By chance about one in
/// 518 would. The step and the offset are empirical; nobody has published a
/// cause. Counted per model, as a share of the responses that got that far.
///
/// **Settings changed under the session.** From Codex 0.144 every change the
/// user makes is written as `thread_settings_applied`, and takes effect at the
/// next `task_started`. A turn whose `turn_context` runs a different model, a
/// lower reasoning effort, or a smaller context window than the settings in
/// force when it started was changed by something other than the user.
/// Sessions written before 0.144 record no such event — a `/model` there is
/// indistinguishable from a silent switch — so they are not judged at all;
/// nor is a newer one with none applied, nor Codex's own helpers (sessions
/// with a `source` or `parent_thread_id`, turns whose `root_turn_id` is
/// another's, the `auto-review` model).
///
/// **A fork copies its parent first**, every copied line stamped with the
/// moment of the fork; those lines are skipped, or a month-old response would
/// be counted twice and dated today.

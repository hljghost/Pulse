                // already laid out narrow.

                // re-applied on every rebuild, which is the property this needs.
                //
                // 200 was measured, not guessed. Scanning the committed English
                // screenshot for the rightmost ink in the list puts the longest
                // label — `GitHub Copilot` — at **150.5pt**, so this leaves about
                // 50pt of trailing air. 240 was tried first and read as baggy:
                // 90pt of empty column beside every row.
                //
                // **The brand names are the constraint, not the translated rows.**
                // That is worth writing down because it is the opposite of what it
                // looks like: "Token 消耗" reaches about 112pt and "开发者集成"
                // less, both short of the latin names, and CJK being twice the
                // width per glyph does not make up the difference over so few
                // characters. So this number does not move with the language — it
                // moves when a provider with a longer name is added, which is how
                // `GLM Coding Plan` quietly became the longest.
                //
                // And moved to 220 when `Alibaba Coding Plan` did: 121.4pt of text
                // at the sidebar's 13pt against `Xiaomi Coding Plan`'s 117.3, and

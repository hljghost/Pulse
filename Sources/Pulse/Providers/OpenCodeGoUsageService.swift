///
/// 1. **A key pasted into Settings**, kept encrypted on this Mac. It wins, because
///    someone who typed a key meant that one to be used — otherwise a stale
///    key left behind by OpenCode would quietly override a deliberate choice.
/// 2. **What OpenCode saved for itself** in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`,
///    which is the same borrowing Claude Code and Codex get, and means anyone
///    already signed in there has nothing to configure.
///
/// The endpoint is `GET /zen/go/v1/usage`, which is not documented — OpenCode's
/// own docs describe only the model endpoints — so it can change without
/// notice, exactly like the two undocumented routes the CLIs use.
///
/// **A third way in: the console's session**, read from the browser in
/// Settings for the request log (`OpenCodeConsole`). The console answers the
/// same three limits at `GET /console/api/go/status`, in money rather than in
/// percent. It is asked when there is no key at all, or when the key route
/// turned the key away or did not answer — never instead of a key that works,
/// so nobody who set one up is moved off it.

# Architecture

Single executable target `Pulse` at `Sources/Pulse`. No internal modules. The floating monitor is **not** a SwiftUI `WindowGroup` scene.

Provider routes, credentials, cookies, and extra-account OAuth belong in [providers/README.md](providers/README.md). This file is the AppKit shell and the settings/state that every provider shares.

## App shell

- `PulseApp.swift` — `@main`. Supplies the required empty SwiftUI Settings scene, but replaces its standard command so Command-, opens the AppKit-owned settings window rather than the empty scene. The AppKit delegate owns the `NSStatusItem` (Settings, Quit) so `AppSettings.hidesMenuBarIcon` can remove it at runtime. Usage is shown solely in the floating panel; when the icon is hidden, the panel menu or a registered global shortcut remains an entry point.
- `AppDelegate.swift` — activation policy `.accessory` (no Dock icon, except while the settings window or the recap window is open — see Settings window and `App/DockPresence.swift`). Owns `AppSettings`, `PanelPlacement`, `FloatingPanelController`, the settings window and the recap window (`RecapWindowController`, opened from the Token spend pane's two recap buttons or a clicked recap notification; neither menu carries an entry for it). Ignores `SIGPIPE` process-wide so a helper (for example Codex app-server) exiting cannot take Pulse down with it (`Terminated due to signal 13`).
- `FloatingPanelController.swift` — owns a custom `NSPanel` (`FloatingPanel`: borderless, non-activating, `canBecomeKey` / `canBecomeMain` both false) hosting SwiftUI through `NSHostingView`. **The AppKit controller computes and animates the panel frame.** SwiftUI has no say over outer size; expand/collapse is `NSAnimationContext` / `panel.animator()`, not a SwiftUI transition.
- Full-screen Spaces: `AppSettings.hidesInFullScreen` selects `.fullScreenNone` (default) or `.fullScreenAuxiliary`. Both keep `.canJoinAllSpaces` for ordinary desktops. This is public window collection behaviour, not a guessed full-screen detector.

`LSUIElement` must be **true** in the bundled `Info.plist`. Setting `.accessory` in code runs after the Dock has already been told what to show, so without the key a Dock icon flashes at every launch. Shipping detail: [releasing.md](releasing.md).

## Settings window

Hand-rolled `SettingsWindowController`, not SwiftUI’s required empty `Settings` scene: an `.accessory` app must `NSApp.activate` or the window opens behind everything. The `.appSettings` command is replaced in `PulseApp`, so the standard keyboard command reaches this controller too.

**Dock icon while open.** An `.accessory` app has no Dock icon and no ⌘-Tab entry, so a settings window another app covered could not be found again. With `AppSettings.showsDockIconInSettings` (**on by default**, callback `onDockIconChange`, never `onChange`) `DockPresence` (`App/DockPresence.swift`, one owner for every window Pulse opens — Settings and the [recap window](recap.md#the-window)) switches to `.regular` when a tracked window shows and back to `.accessory` when the last closes (`SettingsWindow.close()` / `RecapWindow.close()` name the closing window, which still reports visible); a minimised window counts as open, and flipping the switch with the window open applies at once. `LSUIElement` stays true, so nothing shows at launch.

- `.fullSizeContentView` so content blurs under the title bar as it scrolls.
- **Title bar stays opaque** (`titlebarAppearsTransparent = false`, `titlebarSeparatorStyle = .automatic`). Transparent plus full-size content drew scrolled rows over “Pulse Settings”.
- No extra top padding: AppKit reports the bar as a ~52pt safe area and the scroll view already insets by it.
- The sidebar does **not** extend behind the traffic lights. That is AppKit’s treatment of an `NSSplitViewController` sidebar; a SwiftUI `NavigationSplitView` in an `NSHostingView` does not get it. Historical measurement (with/without full-size content and a unified `NSToolbar`) is in the old notes, not re-run here.
- Ending text-field editing on click-away is the **window’s** job (`SettingsWindow.sendEvent`). Geometry against the field being edited, never `hitTest` — a hosted SwiftUI tree answers that unreliably. See [ui/settings.md](ui/settings.md).

## Ways into settings

Four, and the menu bar is only one of them — an icon in a full menu bar is not reachable at all ([issue #24](https://github.com/qunqin24/Pulse/issues/24)):

- The AppKit status-item menu (`AppDelegate`), unless the user has hidden its icon.
- A **secondary click on the rail**, which puts up `AppDelegate.panelMenu()`. [ui/input.md](ui/input.md)
- A **global shortcut**, unset until somebody sets one. `GlobalShortcutMonitor`, held by the app delegate for the life of the process and re-applied by the settings pane whenever a combination changes. The panel's own shortcut goes through `settings.isPanelVisible` rather than `FloatingPanelController.toggle()`, so the panel is in the state the switch in settings claims and stays that way across a launch.
- A `pulse://` link, below.

The first three are kept as an invariant: if no selected provider can supply a visible panel and neither shortcut was actually accepted by the window server, Pulse restores the menu bar item. A stored combination that conflicts with another app does not count. Hiding the icon from Settings first shows the panel when it would otherwise remove the last visible entry point; before the initial provider choice, where no panel exists, the request is refused. Later hiding that panel, clearing the last shortcut, a registration failure, or restoring an unsafe saved combination brings the icon back.

## Settings navigation from other apps

`PulseLink` parses `pulse://settings`, `pulse://integrations`, and `pulse://account/<encoded-id>`. `AppDelegate.application(_:open:)` passes accepted links to `SettingsWindowController`, whose `SettingsNavigation` owns the selected pane shared with SwiftUI. A request id lets a repeated link clear sidebar search and return to the heading, even when the pane is already selected. Account targets must exist in `settings.allAccounts`; links never create a slot or run a repair. `Scripts/bundle.sh` registers the `pulse` URL scheme in `CFBundleURLTypes`. Setup and examples: [integrations.md](integrations.md).

## Panel content (where it lives)

SwiftUI tree inside the panel: `FloatingUsagePanelView` → `UsageDockView` (rail) with `UsageDetailCard` as an **overlay**, not a stack sibling. Geometry, docking, and scale: [ui/panel-geometry.md](ui/panel-geometry.md). Pointer, drag, clicks: [ui/input.md](ui/input.md). Rings, glass, colour: [ui/rings-and-surface.md](ui/rings-and-surface.md).

## Settings and persistence

`AppSettings` is `@Observable`, stored in `UserDefaults` (`AppSettings.defaults`, `.standard` for the app and a throwaway suite in tests, so a test never writes the real preferences).

**One class, nine files.** Swift keeps stored properties in the class body and `@Observable` tracks only those, so `App/AppSettings.swift` is the single list of everything stored — each setting's declaration and doc comment, grouped by topic — plus the init and `restored()`. Each setting's `didSet` is one line calling `<name>Changed(from:)`, and that handler lives in its topic's file together with the topic's keys (`AppSettings.Key`), shipped defaults (`AppSettings.Default`), per-account accessors and restore code: `+Application` (menu bar item, Dock icon, shortcuts, language), `+Panel` (visibility, size, rail metrics, glass, `PanelMetrics` upkeep), `+Rings` (tints, marks, clock, warning colour, pinned window), `+Accounts` (which accounts exist, which are shown, order, `StoredRail`, `removeAccount`), `+Providers` (routes, sites, balance basis, proxy, cadence), `+TokenSpend`, `+Notifications`, `+Recap`, `+WindowStarter`. Three observers (`glassTransparency`, `recapMonthlyPrice`, `enabledAccounts`) stay inline in the main file: they assign to themselves inside `didSet`, which does not re-run the observer, and from a method it would. The memberwise `init` keeps its flat labelled list — callers (`AppSettings(readsTokenSpend: true)`) rely on it, and stored properties must be assigned in the initializer's own body — but its literal defaults are the same `Default` constants `restored()` falls back to. Keys are the stored format; `AppSettingsPersistenceTests` spells them out and round-trips every setting through `restoredSettings(from:)`. A new setting is: a stored property in the main file, a `Key` and (if literal) a `Default` in its topic file, its `…Changed(from:)` there, and its read in `restoredSettings`.

**Two callbacks.** `onChange` is how AppKit hears about settings that change what is fetched or which accounts are shown: `AppDelegate.settingsChanged` re-places the panel **and** `UsageStore.settingsChanged` refreshes every provider. `onLayoutChange` is for settings that change only how the panel is drawn or placed — `panelSize`, `railSpacing`, the rail's figure and end-style switches, `showsWindowClock`, `showsForecast`, `detailedCards`, `usesGlass`, `autoCollapse`, `hidesInFullScreen`, `followsActiveDisplay`, `showsSecondRing`: `AppDelegate.layoutChanged` only re-places the panel (`FloatingPanelController.settingsChanged`) and fetches nothing. They all used to share `onChange`, so choosing a panel size cost every provider a request for figures that had not moved. `AppSettingsLayoutTests` pins which callback each setting fires. The `PanelMetrics` writes in those handlers happen only on the instance the app is drawn from (`drivesPanelMetrics`, set by `restored()`), so a preview's or a test's `AppSettings` cannot resize the panel. `hidesMenuBarIcon` and `showsUsageInMenuBar` are the exceptions: their dedicated callback (`onMenuBarIconChange`) removes, restores or redraws the AppKit status item without refetching providers. With `showsUsageInMenuBar` on, `AppDelegate.showMenuBarReading` draws `MenuBarReading.choose` — `menuBarAccount` while it is on the rail, else the fullest headline window among the shown accounts, skipping unavailable readings and inferred (`estimate`) rings — as that provider's template mark and its percentage, a small ring or its split timed limits (`menuBarStyle`), `systemRed` at the warning threshold or when spent, and re-arms `withObservationTracking` on every change. `menuNeedsUpdate` puts `MenuDashboard` (an `NSHostingView` that resizes the item as its tab changes), the usage-page item and **Refresh** at the top of the status item's menu only; see [ui/settings.md](ui/settings.md). It defaults to `false` to preserve the existing menu bar entry point. With no reading to show, the status item is **Pulse's own mark** — the app icon's P, drawn from `AppIcon/pulse-mark.svg`'s single stroke as a 16-pt template (`MenuBarReading.pulseMark`) — which replaced the SF Symbol `chart.pie.fill`, a stand-in that looked like nothing Pulse is.

- Once monitoring starts the **rail** must not be empty (nothing to hover, nothing to grab). Before the initial choice, an empty account set is valid and the panel is not created. An added account alone is a valid rail; rebuilding from `Provider.allCases` must never overwrite that choice.
- `providerOrder` / `orderedAccounts`: never trust the stored list as written. Drop unknown names; append accounts the list does not mention **in name order** after whatever arrangement is stored. The settings sidebar follows the same order. Reorder does **not** call `onChange` — that path refetches everything.
- **First run and upgrade offers** are resolved by `ProviderSelection.restore`, called from `AppSettings.restored`. First launch enables nothing. An empty or invalid saved set returns to the chooser, never to an everything-on fallback. Discovery suggests providers but enables none; see the startup contract below.
- A provider with nothing fetched yet is **not** seeded `.loading` (`UsageStore.initialState`). Loading that never resolves is a lie on its settings pane.
- Each enabled provider pane has its own refresh control. A switched-off provider is not fetched by the timer, the settings pane, or `UsageStore.refresh(_:)`; its Current usage group says **Not shown** instead of leaving a permanent loading placeholder.
- Where a provider has more than one route, which one is used is `AppSettings.source(for:)` (`UsageSource`). `.automatic` is the default: take the primary route when it can, fall back when it cannot. Pinning reports failure instead of quietly answering from elsewhere. Which routes exist: [providers/README.md](providers/README.md).
- `networkProxy` is one persisted value rather than four independently firing fields. It configures Pulse's external sessions and supported helper processes, then `onChange` queues a full refresh. Scope and the Sparkle exception: [networking.md](networking.md).
- Colour means usage, not brand (`UsageTint`, optional per-account `RingTint`). Spent colour still wins. Spent comes from the **provider’s flags**, not from crossing 100%. See [ui/rings-and-surface.md](ui/rings-and-surface.md).
- The rail ring shows one window: closest to limit, or a pin (`AppSettings.pinnedWindows`). Resolved at display time.

`AccountKey` is provider plus which account. The primary account’s id is the provider’s `rawValue` so stored prefs and cache files need no migration. Extra accounts: Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Grok Bot only (`supportsMultipleAccounts`). How those logins work: [providers/README.md](providers/README.md).

Keys pasted in Settings live in `keys.dat` (`APIKeyStore`), not `UserDefaults`. Extra-account tokens live in `accounts.dat`. Both are AES-GCM, owner-only, key derived from the Mac. **Each store changes its file under one lock** (read, change one entry, write back): Settings saving a key and a console session renewed in the background used to race, and the later write dropped the other's key. A background renewal replaces a credential only while it still holds the one it renewed (`APIKeyStore.replaceKey`, `AccountCredentials.renewed`), so one removed or retyped meanwhile is not written back. Pinned by `APIKeyStoreTests`, in a temporary folder.

## Provider choice before monitoring

`ProviderSetupWindowController` hosts the chooser in a regular AppKit window. On first launch it lists all providers, unchecked, with detected installations first. **Done** needs at least one selection. Closing it or choosing **Not now** leaves the rail absent and the menu bar usable; until a service is chosen, the menu bar menu leads with an item that reopens the chooser, since nothing else on screen says why there is no rail; enabling a service in its Settings pane also completes the initial choice. Dismissing an initial chooser is not saved as completion: the next launch asks again.

The startup gate is the resolved account set, `AppSettings.needsProviderSelection`, not whether any window was dismissed. `AppDelegate` creates the panel and starts `UsageStore` only after that set is non-empty. Store construction seeds placeholders without looking for credentials; `start`, both refresh entry points, and settings-driven refresh also refuse an empty selection. Provider panes load credentials and history automatically only for enabled primary accounts; opening Codex's pane while disabled cannot start its helper. Connection, sign-in, diagnostics and usage controls are built only after the initial choice, so even evaluating their contents cannot read a tool's configuration beforehand. The separate Token spend pane keeps its own workflow.

Claude's desktop Keychain request and status-line offer run only after the primary Claude Code account is enabled, including when enabled later through Settings. A new grant's callback checks it is still enabled before refreshing. Per-provider access descriptions and exact discovery paths belong in [providers/README.md](providers/README.md).

Upgrades preserve the saved enabled account ids, including extra-account-only rails. A provider new to `settings.offeredProviders` is **suggested once**, and only if presence-only discovery found it; existing providers continue monitoring while that chooser is open. Dismissal keeps the existing set. Undetected new providers remain available in Settings. All current providers are stamped as offered during restoration, so a declined upgrade offer does not recur.

**Extensions** are found by `ExtensionCatalog.scan` at launch, before the saved choice is restored, so an extension's account id counts as known and its switch survives; a folder that is gone takes the switch with it on the next launch. They are never in the chooser or in an upgrade offer — `Provider.builtIn` leaves the type out — and a new one starts off. [extensions.md](extensions.md)

**Legacy 1.0.0:** it wrote an offered list but no enabled list until the user edited one. Only an **absent** enabled key is restored from that historical offered list. An explicit empty array, malformed value or unknown-only list goes to the chooser. There is no path that enables all current providers as a recovery strategy.

## Login item

`LoginItem.swift` — on by default, decided **once** (own flag; never re-enable on a later launch). Reads the *system* state, not a stored preference.

- Bundled app: `SMAppService.mainApp` (what System Settings lists).
- `swift run`: that API reports `notFound`. A launch agent is written to `~/Library/LaunchAgents` instead. No `KeepAlive`.
- Rebuilding moves the executable; `repairPathIfNeeded` rewrites a stale agent. `LoginItem.adoptBundleIfNeeded` stops a leftover agent and `SMAppService` both launching after an upgrade.

## UserDefaults domain

A bundled app and `swift run Pulse` use **different** defaults domains (bundle id vs process name). `LegacyDefaults` copies the old `Pulse` domain into the bundle domain **once**, only keys the new domain does not already have. After that they diverge on purpose. Details: [decisions/bundle-and-defaults.md](decisions/bundle-and-defaults.md).
